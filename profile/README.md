# Paradigms of Intelligence
Advance our understanding of how intelligence evolves to develop new technologies for the benefit of humanity and other sentient life.

## About Pi
Paradigms of Intelligence (Pi), a research team at Google, brings together an interdisciplinary group of world-class researchers, engineers, and philosophers to explore the fundamental building blocks of intelligence and the conditions under which it can emerge. Just as intelligence arose through billions of years of evolution, we believe that embracing a bottom-up approach – while drawing on insights from the physical, biological, and social sciences – will allow us to develop more efficient, adaptable, and human AI.

## Our Work
#### The Paradigms of Intelligence team at Google is focused on the paradigm shifts below… and others.

*Natural computing* - Computing existed in nature long before we built the first “artificial computers.” Pi is developing a new theoretical framework for understanding  the evolution of increasingly complex life and intelligence as a natural phenomenon. This provides a deeper understanding of the principles underlying complexity and cooperation in evolved systems. Our insights can, in turn, inspire new approaches to designing, developing, and aligning artificial intelligence.

*Neural computing* - Our brains are computational. Redesigning the computers powering AI to work more like brains will greatly increase AI’s energy efficiency, and perhaps its capabilities too. Our insights suggest AI infrastructure is still constrained by classical computing principles, relying on sequential instructions and conventional chip architectures. While GPUs and TPUs are a step forward, true neural computing requires a shift toward massively parallel processing and data locality.

*Predictive intelligence* - The success of Large Language Models shows us something fundamental about the nature of intelligence: it is statistical modeling of the future (including one’s own future actions) given a growing body of knowledge, observations, and feedback from the past. Our insights suggest that current distinctions between designing, training, and running AI models are fuzzy; more sophisticated AI will evolve, grow, and learn continuously and interactively, as we do.

*Collective intelligence* -  Brains, AI models, and societies can all become more capable through greater scale. Intelligence is fundamentally modular and social, powered by mutual modeling, cooperation, and division of labor. In addition to causing us to rethink the nature of human (or “more than human”) intelligence, our insights suggest social and multiagent approaches to AI development that could reduce computational costs, increase AI diversity, and reframe AI safety debates.
